# Swift-Audio-Player
A basic audio player created using SwiftUI for iOS

The goal of this solution is really to better myself with SwiftUI, play with AVKit, and work with the Swift framework to retrieve music from the device filesystem using UIDocumentPicker.

The result will be a "lite" music player for mp3/lossless formats that is dependent on a NAS as its primary datasource.  I'll add functionality down the road to copy local NAS music over to the device for times of travel.
